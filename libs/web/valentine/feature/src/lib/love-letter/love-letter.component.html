        I've been thinking about us lately &mdash; the whole wild, ridiculous,
        beautiful story of us. A Tinder match in the summer of 2015. A boy
        from Birmingham. A girl from Augusta. Three years of Snapchat
        conversations, near-misses, and excuses that were really just
        nerves neither of us would admit to.
      </p>
      <p>
        You were this mystery girl who was absolutely stunning, hilarious, and
        seemed to like everything I liked (though I'm now fairly certain you
        were just stalking my interests online). You made it so obvious you
        were into me while I played it cool &mdash; badly. Every time we were
        supposed to meet, one of us would find a "reasonable" excuse. I think
        we were both terrified that the real thing might be even better than
        what we'd built up in our heads.
      </p>
      <p>
        September 2018. Northside Tavern. Seven beers deep, playing pool
        with Seth, and you texted asking what I was doing. The liquid
        courage kicked in just enough to say "I'm coming." Seth thought you
        were a 40-year-old man living in his mom's basement. I'm so glad
        you weren't. He drove me to your apartment in Midtown, my heart
        pounding out of my chest as I rode that elevator to the 10th floor,
        hoping it would break down halfway up. It didn't. I walked to the end
        of that hallway, heard your music blaring, and then your voice for the
        very first time: <em>"It's unlocked!!!"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That door opened and there you were &mdash; arms wide, biggest smile
        I'd ever seen, walking toward me like we'd known each other forever.
        Then you poured us Fireball shots and I immediately thought:
        <em>that's my girl.</em> (OK, I actually thought you were either
        nervous or an alcoholic. But also: that's my girl.)
      </p>
      <p>
        You were unbelievably stunning. Drop dead gorgeous. Absolutely tiny
        &mdash; I felt like I could fit you in my pocket. 5 foot even, though
        you insist on that extra inch. Your smile was infectious. The
        conversation was effortless. And the next morning, my stupid ass
        texted YOU instead of Seth: "it went amazing &mdash; probably spent
        a million dollars." Your response? "I can Venmo you if you want."
        The horror.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then there was Vietnam. You texted that you loved me completely out of
        the blue. I panicked, sweated for three hours, and responded with
        about 30 multicolored heart emojis. You were so mad. But I was falling
        so hard I didn't know what to do with myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then that promotion dinner &mdash; you planned the most thoughtful
        evening at the nicest steakhouse in Atlanta to celebrate me. And
        halfway through, my body decided to betray me in the most violent,
        disgusting way possible. I turned on your shower to cover the sounds.
        I took the elevator down ten flights to use the lobby bathroom. And at
        3 AM, sweet Victoria loaded me into the car, drove to get Gatorade,
        Pepto-Bismol, and Pedialyte, and nursed me back to health. That was
        the moment I knew. Not when you looked stunning. Not when you
        laughed at my jokes. When you showed up at 3 AM with Pedialyte.
        That's love.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast forward through a new career as a flight attendant, a cross-country
        move to Philly (where I drove a U-Haul 14 hours through the night while
        you slept in the passenger seat &mdash; after swearing you wouldn't),
        and suddenly I'm on one knee in Rittenhouse Park in December 2023, asking
        you to be my wife. My heart was beating just as hard as it was at that
        elevator on the 10th floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        September 29, 2024. Lecce, Puglia, Italy. Just our families. No
        distractions. I told myself I wasn't going to cry when you walked down
        the aisle. I cried like a BITCH. The most gorgeous, beautiful, tender
        angel was walking toward me &mdash; and she was allllllll mine. Forever.
        I tear up now when I think of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've traveled the world together &mdash; Italy (countless times),
        Portugal, Ireland, South Africa, Spain, France, Costa Rica, Greece,
        and more. We've had hard times. Real ones. Breakups that weren't
        real breakups, deaths in the family, cross-country moves, and more
        than I can name. And we overcame every single one. We grew stronger.
        We learned how to love each other better.
      </p>
      <p>
        I built this because a Hallmark card could never hold everything
        I feel for you. You are ferociously loyal, impossibly thoughtful,
        stronger than anyone I know, and the most beautiful person I have
        ever seen in my life. You are authentically, unapologetically
        yourself &mdash; and you're not changing for anyone. I wouldn't
        want you to.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are my Fireball-shot-pouring, Pedialyte-fetching, TikTok-doom-scrolling,
        iced-matcha-drinking, Justin-Bieber-loving, 5-foot-nothing angel.
        And I can't believe you're mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you more than words (or code) could ever express.
