      <p>
        From the moment I met you, I knew my life would never be the same.
        You brought color into a world I didn't even know was grey. Every
        day with you feels like a new favorite song I never want to stop
        playing.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we said "I do" in September 2024, I thought my heart couldn't
        possibly feel any fuller. But you prove me wrong every single day.
        You are my best friend, my greatest adventure, and the love of my
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I built this little app because I wanted you to know that every
        song reminds me of you. Every melody carries a memory of us. Every
        beat matches the rhythm of my heart when I'm with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You once said I hadn't asked you to be my Valentine yet&hellip;
        well, I wanted to do it in a way you'd never forget.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you more than words (or code) could ever express.
