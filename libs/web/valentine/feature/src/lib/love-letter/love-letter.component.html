        Okay my angel, so I tried to write you a normal Valentine's Day card but cards are
        expensive nowadays and you know, I got laid off from my job sooo times are tough. 
        I kept thinking about how you sent me that guy's "Will you be my Valentine?" one page, one section application he built for his girlfriend (lol). Wolfe could have built that.
        I was getting desperate so I thought about getting a tattoo of you on my lowerback and Folly talked me out of it. 
        So I built you a whole app. Because you deserve only the best. And by God, I'm going to 
        give it to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was thinking about what I wanted to say, I kept thinking about how crazy our story is. We matched on Tinder
        in 2015. <em>2015.</em> I was an intern at PwC, you were at Kennesaw State / working, then Harry Norman
        and for three years we just would send a periodic message her and there, like an instagram post, you'd send some random link to something.
        We'd make "plans" and then one of us would bail. Every single time. I
        think we were both scared that meeting in person would either ruin it
        or make it too real. Probably the second one.
      </p>
      <p>
        You were way too obvious about being already obsessed with me. Not
        subtle at all. Meanwhile I was over here playing it cool, taking 8 hours to respond to your messages.
        I'm also pretty sure you would stalk me on social media and just Googling everything
        I was into and pretending you liked it too. Don't you lie, biscuit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then September 2018. I'm at Northside Tavern, seven beers deep,
        playing pool with Seth. You text me. And I don't know if it was
        the beer or the fact that I'd been chickening out for three years,
        but I just said "I'm coming." Seth was fully convinced
        you were a 40-year-old man catfishing me from his mom's basement
        &mdash; drove me to your apartment anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        The elevator ride to the 10th floor was the longest of my life. I
        genuinely wanted it to get stuck so I had an excuse to leave. It
        didn't. I walked down the hallway, heard your music blasting (nothing has changed), and
        then I heard your voice for the first time: <em>"It's unlocked!!!"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The door opened and there you were. Cute ass outfit. Biggest smile.
        Walking at me like we'd done this a thousand times. Then you poured
        two Fireball shots immediately and honestly I didn't know if you were nervous or an
        alcoholic but either way I was like <em>THAT'S MY GIRL.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember how gorgeous you looked. Even better than the photos. Unreasonably
        pretty. And TINY. I almost put you in my pocket. 5 foot
        even (I know you claim 5'1" LOL). And then my dumb ass
        woke up the next morning and texted YOU instead of Seth: "it went
        amazing &mdash; probably spent a million dollars." And you said something like
        "I can Venmo you if you want." I could've jumped in front of the Septa.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then you texted me "I love you" while I was in Vietnam. Just out of
        nowhere. No buildup, no warning. I stared at my phone for three
        hours and sent back like 30 heart emojis in every color. You were
        furious. Looking back, fair.
      </p>
      <p>
        You planned that promotion dinner at the nicest steakhouse in Atlanta
        &mdash; the most thoughtful thing anyone had ever done for me &mdash;
        and halfway through, my body just completely gave up on me. I won't
        get into details but I turned on your shower to cover the sounds and
        at one point took the elevator down TEN FLOORS to use the lobby
        bathroom. And at 3 AM you just got me to the car. Drove to CVS.
        Came back with Gatorade, Pepto, and Pedialyte. Didn't complain once.
        That's when I knew... You, at
        3 AM, driving a sick boy with gastrointestinal issues to CVS to fix his tummy. I thought, "I'm gonna marry this girl."
      </p>
      <p>
        Then everything happened fast. You became a flight attendant, we
        moved to Philly (I drove a U-Haul 14 hours through the night while
        you slept in the passenger seat &mdash; after SWEARING you'd stay
        awake). And then in December 2023 I'm on one knee in Rittenhouse Park
        and my heart is beating just as hard as it was in that elevator.
      </p>
      <p>
        September 29, 2024. Lecce, Puglia. Just our families. I told
        myself I wasn't going to cry. I cried like a BITCH. You came down
        that aisle and I lost it. You were the most beautiful
        thing I'd ever seen and you were about to be mine forever. I still
        get choked up thinking about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've been through a lot. Real stuff. The kind of stuff that breaks
        people up. And we're still here. Stronger. Better. Italy a million
        times, Portugal, Ireland, South Africa, Spain, France, Costa Rica,
        Greece. But also the hard things &mdash; the fights, the distance,
        the losses. All of it. We figured it out every time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I built this whole thing because a Hallmark card wasn't going to cut it.
        You're the most loyal person I know. You're stronger than you think.
        You're so thoughtful it honestly makes me feel bad about myself sometimes.
        And you're completely, stubbornly, unapologetically yourself. You're
        not changing for anyone. I'd never want you to.
      </p>
      <p>
        You're my 5-foot-nothing, Fireball-pouring, Pedialyte-at-3AM,
        matcha-drinking, TikTok-scrolling, Bieber-loving angel. And you
        somehow picked me. Still can't believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you. Happy Valentine's Day.
