    <div class="letter-greeting">My Dearest Victoria,</div>
    <div class="letter-body">
      <p>
        From the moment I met you, I knew my life would never be the same. You brought color into
        a world I didn't even know was grey. Every day with you feels like a new favorite song
        I never want to stop playing.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we said "I do" in September 2024, I thought my heart couldn't possibly feel any fuller.
        But you prove me wrong every single day. You are my best friend, my greatest adventure,
        and the love of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I built this little app because I wanted you to know that every song reminds me of you.
        Every melody carries a memory of us. Every beat matches the rhythm of my heart when
        I'm with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You once said I hadn't asked you to be my Valentine yet... well, I wanted to do it
        in a way you'd never forget.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you more than words (or code) could ever express.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="letter-signature">
      Forever yours,<br/>
